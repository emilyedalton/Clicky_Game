# Clicky Game 


This project is a memory game created with React. 


## How it works: 

When the user selects a painting, the application listens for click events which increment the score by 1 and shuffles the order of the objects using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.  However, if the user selects the same image twice in a row their score is set to 0, meaning they lost the game. 



## Whats up with these paintings? 

This application features the work of Russian artist Kazimir Severinovich Malevich. Malevich was a pioneer in abstract, non-representational art and his work has a profound impact on 20th century modernism.
